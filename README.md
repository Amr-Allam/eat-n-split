**Eat'n'Split** is a web app that helps groups easily split expenses and keep track of who owes whom. Perfect for dining out, group activities, or shared costs with friends.

I built this project on my own as part of my learning journey with **React** and JavaScript. It allows users to add friends, track shared expenses, and automatically calculate who owes what.

## Features:

- Add friends.
- Split expenses and track balances.

## How to Run:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the app: `npm start`
